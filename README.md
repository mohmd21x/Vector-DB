# Vector Database Search Speed Comparison

This repository contains a project that benchmarks the search speeds of various vector databases, including FAISS, ScaNN, ChromaDB, and numpy's L2 distance function. The objective is to evaluate and compare their performance to identify the most efficient option for tasks requiring rapid nearest neighbor searches.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the search performance of different vector databases to determine which one offers the fastest search capabilities. This information is crucial for applications that require efficient nearest neighbor search, such as recommendation systems, image retrieval, and more.

## Vector Databases Compared
- **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):** A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors):** A scalable and efficient library for approximate nearest neighbor search developed by Google.
- **ChromaDB:** A modern vector database optimized for high-performance and scalability.
- **Numpy L2 Distance:** A basic implementation using numpy for computing the L2 (Euclidean) distance.

## Methodology
1. **Dataset:**
   - Description of the dataset used for benchmarking (e.g., size, dimension of vectors).
   - Preprocessing steps taken to prepare the data.

2. **Implementation:**
   - Details on how each vector database was set up and configured.
   - Code snippets or references to scripts used for the benchmarking process.

3. **Benchmarking Process:**
   - Explanation of the benchmarking procedure.
   - Metrics used for comparison (e.g., query time, throughput).

## Results
The results of the benchmarking tests are summarized, with visualizations (graphs, charts) comparing the search speeds of the different vector databases. The analysis discusses which database performed best under various conditions and provides insights and recommendations based on the benchmarking results.
